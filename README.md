# The difference between Mitre ATT&cK & Cyber KILL CHAIN


## First we get to know both 

### what is MITRE ATT&cK?
`MITRE ATT&CK` is a framework that categorizes the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by cyber attackers during various stages of an intrusion.

### what is Cyber KILL Chain?
The `Cyber Kill Chain` is a framework that describes the stages of a cyberattack, from initial reconnaissance to achieving the attacker's objectives, helping organizations understand and defend against advanced threats.

# Whats the diff?
The main difference between MITRE ATT&CK and the Cyber Kill Chain lies in their focus and purpose

  `MITRE ATT&CK`
        Focuses on categorizing the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers during different stages of a cyber intrusion.
        Provides a detailed matrix of specific techniques used by attackers.
        Helps organizations understand and improve their defenses against cyber threats by mapping out the tactics and techniques attackers use.

  `Cyber Kill Chain`
        Describes the sequential stages of a cyberattack, from initial reconnaissance to achieving the attacker's objectives.
        Provides a high-level framework for understanding the progression of an attack.
        Helps organizations identify and disrupt attacks by breaking down the attack process into distinct phases.


## so ?
In summary, the main difference between `MITRE ATT&CK` and the `Cyber Kill Chain` lies in their focus and granularity. `MITRE ATT&CK` provides a detailed breakdown of the tactics and techniques used by attackers, while the `Cyber Kill Chain` offers a broader overview of the sequential stages of a cyberattack. Both frameworks are valuable for understanding and defending against cyber threats, but they serve different purposes and levels of detail.
